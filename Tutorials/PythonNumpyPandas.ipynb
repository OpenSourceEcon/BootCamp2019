    "Python has three main environments in which we will manipulate data. First, Python has its own native data structures that can be effectively used. However, these Python structures are often more general than a researcher might want. `Numpy` provides some extra structure on numerical arrays that is often helpful in scientific computing. For traditional data analysis where the unit of analysis is an obervation, the `pandas` library is a great environment in Python for working with data."

The `DataFrame` has both row and column index; it can be thought of as a `dict` of `Series` (one for all sharing the same index). Compared with other such `DataFrame`-like structures you may have used before (like R's `data.frame`), row-oriented and column-oriented operations in `DataFrame` are treated roughly symmetrically.

As with the univariate `Series` object, the `DataFrame` allows for traditional data analysis facility while interacting with all of Python's other functionality. You will notice that many of the methods available to pandas `DataFrames` are also available in `numpy`. Their methods are usually equivalent, but the advantage of performing operations with the `DataFrame` is its respect for the index values."
