More accurately, it is a rare and special case to find characterizing functions for which standard root finders and minimizers solve robustly. Press, et al (2007, pp. 442-443) highlight that with nonlinear multidimensional root finding problems,\n",

    "Because root finding and minimization is so difficult, we take great care to report the errors and optimization output in our code. One must show not only that the minimizer or root finder stopped iterating, but also that the errors in the characterizing equations are arbitrarily small. One can also perform robustness tests using varying initial values to provide evidence that the solution is unique in the neighborhood of the solution."
