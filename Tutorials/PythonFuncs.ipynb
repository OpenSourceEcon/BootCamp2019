    "# Writing Functions in Python\n",
    "**by [Richard W. Evans](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon/), April 2018**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html). Functions are objects that accept a specific set of inputs, perform operations on those inputs, and return a set of outputs based on those inputs. Python is a language that focuses on functions. Further, the importing of packages expands the set of functions available to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learn the basics of writing a function in Python, some best practices about docstrings and documentation, and some of the art of using functions to make your code modular. **Modularity** of code is the principle of writing functions for operations that occur multiple times so that a change to that operation only has to be changed once in the code rather than in every instance of the operation. Furthermore, the principle of code modularity also make it easier to take pieces of your code and plug them into other projects as well as combining other projects with your code."

    "## 1. The form of a Python function\n",
    "You can define a function in a Python module or script by using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, a parenthesized list of inputs, and a colon `:`. You then include the operations you want your function to perform by typing lines of executable code, each of which begins with an indent of four spaces. Finally, if you want your function to return any objects, those objects are listed in a comma-separated list following the `return` keyword as the last indented line of the function.\n",

    "Also note that we could have written that function `string2together` with only one line of executable code by combining the two lines in the following way: `return str1 + ' ' + str2`. It is best to keep the return statement clean by only returning objects that have already been created in the body of the function. This makes the function's operation more accessible and transparent.\n",

Imagine a process that concatenated two strings with a space in between many times. Now assume you wanted to change some of those instances to be reversed order with a comma separating them. This could be done quickly by changing the one instance of this function rather than each time the operation is called. More on this in Section 4 on modularity."
