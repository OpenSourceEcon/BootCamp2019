    "# Resampling Methods\n",
    "### by [Richard W. Evans](https://sites.google.com/site/rickecon/), February 2019\n",
    "The code in this Jupyter notebook was written using Python 3.6. It uses data files [`Titanic dataset`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigDataGal/Python-for-Data-Science/master/titanic-train.csv). For the code to run properly, you will either need to have access to the internet or you should have the data file in the same folder as the Jupyter notebook file. Otherwise, you will have to change the respective lines of the code that read in the data to reflect the location of that data. Some other good resampling content in R is Dr. Benjamin Soltoff's resampling methods notes [here](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/persp006_resampling.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling methods are a way to test the sensitivity of statistical results to estimation using a different sample. It is often too difficult or too expensive to draw a new sample from the population. Resampling methods take advantage of the training-set test-set paradigm to evaluate the sensitivity of estimates to sample variance. The two main classes of resampling methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cross validation\n",
    "2. Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In choosing models to predict or match data or to infer relationships between variables, James, et al (2013) decompose the process into *model assessment* and *model selection*. Model assessment is treated in this notebook. It is the process and various means of evaluating the fit or accuracy of a given model. Model selection is the process of adjusting parameters, variables, or functional relationships between variables to better fit the data."

    "The primary measure of fit is the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimated model on the test set. Let the test set have $N$ observations. The MSE of the test set is the sum of squared deviations of the actual dependent variable values minus the predicted values.\n",

You want the false positive rate to be low for any given true positive rate. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC). The AUROC is the opposite of a measure of error. The bigger the AUROC, the more accurate predictor is the model.\n",

    "## 3. How to use cross validation for model assessment and selection\n",
    "*Model assessment* is the process of evaluating the performance of a particular model estimated on training data on its prediction accuracy on test data. There are many criteria for model assessment. The most common measure of model accuracy on test data is the mean squared error $MSE$ or root mean squared error $rMSE$. However, we have seen that the measure $MSE$ varies depending on which cross validation method is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "[JWHT13] define *Model selection* as the process of \"selecting the proper level of flexibility for a model. That is, they define model selection as a process of tuning a particular family or class of models to maximize accuracy on test set prediction. So model selection involves model assessment. However, one can expand this definition of model selection to include testing multiple families or classes of model in terms of accuracy--a horse race.\n",
    "\n",
    "The narrower [JWHT13] definition of model selection is analogous to maximizing the efficiency of a particular horse and rider in a horse race in which the horse is racing against itself. My broader definition of model selection is analogous running a number of horses in a race, with each horse being optimized for efficiency. In this broader definition, many variables are at play and the data must be sampled many times (think of cross-validation optimization on each horse [model]).\n",
    "\n",
    "This broader definition of model selection is computationally intensive. But that is where TensorFlow shines. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open source software library developed by the Google Brain AI group. Broadly, TensorFlow is a system of libraries that facilitate efficient, parallel, and scalable use of available processors (CPUs and GPUs) as well as memory management. For statistical learning, TensorFlow is optimized to efficiently run model assessment and model selection algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many good empirical papers run a horse race on tuned statistical learning models to maximize predictive accuracy. It is hard to know *ex ante* which model will be the most accurate."
