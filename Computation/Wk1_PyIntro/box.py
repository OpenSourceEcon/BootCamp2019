    Check to see whether or not a roll is valid. That is, check if there
    exists a combination of the entries of 'remaining' that sum up to
    'roll'.

    Parameters:
        roll (int): The value of a dice roll, between 2 and 12
                    (inclusive).
        remaining (list): The list of the numbers that still need to be
                          removed before the box can be shut.

    Returns:
        True if the roll is valid.
        False if the roll is invalid.
